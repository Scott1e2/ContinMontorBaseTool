# Enhanced Continuous Monitoring Tool

## Overview
This tool provides real-time continuous monitoring with advanced capabilities:
1. **Log Aggregation**: Collects logs from multiple sources for centralized monitoring.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies deviations from normal patterns, including high login failure rates and data transfer spikes.
3. **Behavioral Analytics**: Establishes baselines for typical user and system behavior, alerting on deviations.
4. **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends alerts based on detected anomalies and behavior deviations.

## Features
### Log Aggregation
- **Centralized Log Collection**: Aggregates logs from structured (JSON) and unstructured (plain text) sources at configurable intervals.
- **Source Configuration**: Define multiple log sources in `config.json`.

### Anomaly Detection
- **Threshold-Based Detection**: Identifies anomalies, such as high login failures or unexpected data transfer spikes.
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Customize detection thresholds to meet security requirements.

### Behavioral Analytics
- **Baseline Monitoring**: Establishes a baseline for behavior over a configurable period (e.g., 30 days).
- **Deviation Alerts**: Notifies when activity deviates significantly from baseline.

### Real-Time Alerts
- **Multi-Channel Alerting**: Alerts can be sent to multiple channels (e.g., email, Slack).
- **Configurable Severity Thresholds**: Only alerts above a defined severity level are sent.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/continuous-monitoring-enhanced.git
    cd continuous-monitoring-enhanced
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Open `config.json` to define log sources, detection thresholds, baseline periods, and alert settings.
   - Adjust settings based on monitoring requirements.

## Usage
1. **Run the Continuous Monitoring Tool**:
    ```bash
    python continuous_monitoring.py
    ```
   - Aggregates logs, detects anomalies, and analyzes behavior in real time.

2. **Configuration File (`config.json`)**:
   - Defines log sources, detection thresholds, baseline period, and alert channels.

## Configuration Example (`config.json`)
```json
{
    "log_aggregation": {
        "sources": [
            "/path/to/log1.json",
            "/path/to/log2.log"
        ],
        "aggregation_frequency": "hourly"
    },
    "anomaly_detection": {
        "enabled": true,
        "thresholds": {
            "login_failure_rate": 0.3,
            "data_transfer_spike": 1.5
        }
    },
    "behavioral_analytics": {
        "baseline_period": "30d",
        "alert_on_deviation": true
    },
    "alerts": {
        "enable_real_time_alerts": true,
        "alert_channels": ["email", "slack"],
        "severity_threshold": "high"
    }
}
```
